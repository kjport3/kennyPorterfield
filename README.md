This is my personal website and blog CMS. I hope to update it 3x per week with new blog posts and still have many features to add, projects to work on, plus a lot of refactoring to do to make the code on it look better and be more maintainable. 

My first ever personal website was a simple page with an introduction to me written on it, and not much else. Then I decided to add a blog section to keep track of whatever I learn. I built out the site but anytime I wanted to create a new post I had to create a new html file and upload it to my hosting service and change the links everywhere else in the site to reference it if I wanted a reference to be to it anywhere. I knew that I had to built a site better than that but didn't go back to working on it for a while.

When I got back to it while learning PHP, I decided to make the content be data driven, create a backend admin side to the site and build a CMS. What I have now is the result, and it does still need work but I think it's pretty good to be made outside of any framework. I think I will pick up Laravel at some point and a lot of the features that I'm building out can be done very easily out of the box with the framework, but I want the experience of building it myself first before diving into having a framework help me out.
